    ///
    /// Inactive nodes are mounted in the overlay at `opacity(0)` so that
    /// their native view identity is preserved across interaction toggles.
    /// Most native views (`WKWebView`, `AVPlayerView`) keep their internal
    /// rendering loops alive in this state and light up instantly once
    /// opacity flips back to 1. **Metal-backed views that gate their draw
    /// pipeline on layer visibility — notably `MKMapView` and `SCNView` —
    /// do not**: while the hosting layer is at opacity 0, their drawable
    /// scheduling is suspended and tile / frame requests are never issued.
    /// When opacity returns to 1 the view is still "paused" and the user
    /// sees blank content until something nudges it.
    ///
    /// Representables wrapping such views should watch for the false → true
    /// edge of `isFlowNodeInteractive` (via a coordinator that remembers the
    /// last value) and force a fresh render pass. For `MKMapView` the
    /// canonical kick is a layout followed by re-applying the current
