/// at opacity 1).
///
/// Without this split, interaction end looks like:
///
/// 1. User moves cursor off → intent flips to `false`
/// 2. Overlay opacity 1 → 0 **instantly**
/// 3. Canvas rasterize path draws the stale cached snapshot
/// 4. Async snapshot provider completes, writes fresh snapshot
/// 5. Canvas redraws with the new snapshot
///
/// The window between steps 2 and 5 is where the user sees the old
/// thumbnail — noticeable for WKWebView / MKMapView where pan/zoom state
/// visibly differs from the cached image.
///
/// The coordinator inverts that order:
///
/// 1. User moves cursor off → intent flips to `false`
/// 2. Coordinator enters **ending interaction**: `renderedInteractive` stays `true`,
///    overlay opacity remains 1, Canvas skip remains in effect
/// 3. Coordinator awaits the registered snapshot provider
/// 4. Snapshot writes fresh snapshot to the store
/// 5. `renderedInteractive` flips to `false`, overlay fades, Canvas now draws
///    the fresh snapshot as the first visible frame
///
/// If the user re-hovers during step 3 the in-flight interaction-end task is
/// cancelled and `renderedInteractive` stays `true` throughout — no flicker.
///
/// The coordinator is injected by `FlowCanvas` via
/// `\.liveNodeInteractionCoordinator`; `LiveNode` registers its snapshot
/// provider on appear and unregisters on disappear.
