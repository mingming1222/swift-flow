import SwiftUI

/// Hosts live node views (WKWebView, MKMapView, AVPlayerView, etc.)
/// on top of the Canvas.
///
/// Placed in a ZStack above the Canvas so each interactive node is a real
/// SwiftUI view rather than a Canvas symbol, letting native representables
/// retain their own rendering loop, scroll views, video decoders, and input
/// handling while visible.
///
/// ## Mount policy
///
/// A row is mounted here only when it is **interactive** (the interaction
/// predicate currently returns true) or **warming up** (no snapshot has been
/// captured yet).
/// Everything else falls through to the Canvas `resolveSymbol` path,
/// which draws the stored snapshot image via `FlowNodeSnapshot` — cheap,
/// and the reason large flows with dozens of idle LiveNodes stay
/// responsive during pan/zoom. Mounting every visible LiveNode (even at
/// opacity 0) paid SwiftUI layout, transform, and `TimelineView` tick
/// costs for nodes the user couldn't see.
///
/// The warmup mount is what initially boots native representables —
/// WKWebView starts loading, MKMapView fetches tiles, AVPlayer prepares
/// an item — so their `.manual(capture:)` handler has a surface to pull
/// a snapshot from. Once `context.snapshot` is non-nil the row unmounts
/// and the Canvas takes over drawing.
///
/// Trade-off: `.onInteraction` rows do not preserve SwiftUI view identity
/// across interaction end. Use `.persistent` for native representables
/// whose renderer, scroll state, or helper process depends on the same
/// view instance staying attached. For SwiftUI-only `LiveNode`s the
/// snapshot captured on interaction end keeps the rasterize frame visually
/// identical, so the swap is seamless.
///
/// ## Intent driver
///
/// The interaction predicate is still evaluated for every viewport-visible
/// node (cheap — just a bool per node) and forwarded to the coordinator,
/// so predicate true-edges trigger the mount. Only the heavy subtree —
/// `nodeContent(...)` with `.live` phase injected — is gated on
/// `isRenderedInteractive`.
///
/// ## Plain-node pass-through
///
/// Not every interactive row contains a `LiveNode` — callers mix live nodes
/// with plain content (e.g. `.resizable` nodes). Rows that actually host
/// a `LiveNode` publish their ID via ``LiveNodePresenceKey``; rows absent
/// from the aggregated set keep `opacity = 0` and hit testing off, so
/// Canvas-level drag / selection gestures pass through to the node
/// underneath.
///
/// ## Two-phase interaction end
///
/// Interaction "rendered" state is owned by
/// ``LiveNodeInteractionCoordinator``, not by the raw predicate result.
/// When the predicate flips `true → false` the coordinator awaits the
/// `LiveNode`-registered capture handler before lowering `renderedInteractive`
/// — so the rasterize path has a fresh snapshot the instant the overlay
/// unmounts. The overlay reads `coordinator.renderedInteractive` to decide
/// which rows to mount, and feeds each body evaluation back in with
/// `update(...)` so predicate edges trigger the coordinator's transitions.
///
/// The overlay layer itself does not paint any background, so empty space
/// between interactive nodes passes pointer events through to the Canvas
/// underneath.
